    <!-- Habitat and Diet Section -->
    <h2 id="habitat">Habitat and Diet</h2>
    <p>Sloths primarily live in rainforests, where they can easily blend into the environment. Their diet consists mostly of leaves, which are low in nutrients and contribute to their slow energy metabolism.</p>

    <!-- Behavior Section -->
    <h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
    <p>Sloths are known for their slow and deliberate movements. They sleep for up to 20 hours a day and have adapted to spending most of their lives hanging upside down in trees.</p>
